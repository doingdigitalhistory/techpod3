        <h2>Thesis</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Initially a supporter of American expansionism, Mark Twain would eventually become a prominent anti-imperialist and vocally opposed American colonialism. These beliefs became a foundational theme for his writing.</strong>
        </p>

        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            Twain’s early optimism about progress gave way to a sharp critique of imperialism. His essay “To the Person Sitting in Darkness” condemns U.S. colonial practices, while his letters reveal deep moral outrage. Themes of freedom and resistance in <em>Huckleberry Finn</em> echo this stance.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Twain’s transformation underscores the tension between national ambition and moral responsibility—a debate that remains relevant today.
