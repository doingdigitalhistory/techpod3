            <h2>Thesis</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Initially a supporter of American expansionism, Mark Twain would eventually become a prominent
                anti-imperialist and vocally opposed American colonialism. These beliefs became a foundational theme
                for his writing. An examination of these themes reveals a consistent moral critique of hypocrisy and
                injustice throughout his career.</strong>

            <h2>Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                Twain’s early works, such as <em>Life on the Mississippi</em>, reflect optimism about progress and modernization.
                However, his later writings—especially “To the Person Sitting in Darkness”—show a dramatic shift toward
                condemning imperialism as a betrayal of democratic ideals. This evolution mirrors his personal struggles
                and growing disillusionment with authority.
            </p>
            <p>
                In <em>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em>, Twain critiques societal hypocrisy through Huck’s moral dilemmas.
                This theme of questioning authority and imposed morality resonates with his later political stance against
                America’s imperial ambitions. His letters from the Anti-Imperialist period further confirm that his opposition
                was not rhetorical but deeply personal and principled.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Twain’s transformation from expansionist sympathizer to anti-imperialist advocate underscores the complexity
                of his worldview. His writings and letters offer a powerful lens to examine the tension between national
                ambition and moral responsibility—a debate that remains relevant today.
