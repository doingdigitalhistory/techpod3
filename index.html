            <p>
                This digital history project explores the life and ideas of Mark Twain through his letters and writings.
                By examining four key sources, we uncover how Twain’s personal struggles and beliefs—particularly his
                opposition to imperialism—shaped his literary voice and political stance.

            <h2>Who Was Mark Twain?</h2>
            <p>
                Mark Twain (born Samuel Langhorne Clemens, 1835–1910) was one of America’s most influential writers and
                humorists. Best known for classics like <em>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em> and <em>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</em>,
                Twain captured the complexities of American life during the 19th century. Beyond literature, he was a sharp
                social critic, outspoken against imperialism, and deeply skeptical of organized religion. His life was marked
                by both triumph and tragedy—financial struggles, family losses, and a relentless pursuit of truth through satire.
