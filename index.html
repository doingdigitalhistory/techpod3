            <p>
                This project explores Mark Twain’s transformation from a supporter of American expansionism to a leading anti-imperialist.
                Through his letters and writings, we examine how these beliefs shaped his literary themes and political voice.

            <h2>About Mark Twain</h2>
            <p>
                Mark Twain (Samuel Langhorne Clemens, 1835–1910) was an American writer and humorist best known for
                <em>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em> and <em>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</em>. His later years were marked by outspoken
                opposition to imperialism and a deep critique of hypocrisy in society.
