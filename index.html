            <h2>About This Project</h2>
            <p>
                This project examines Mark Twain’s evolving beliefs about American expansionism and imperialism.
                Initially supportive of U.S. growth, Twain later became a leading voice against colonialism.
                Through his letters and writings, we explore how these convictions shaped his literary themes
                and political activism.

            <h2>About Mark Twain</h2>
            <p>
                Mark Twain (Samuel Langhorne Clemens, 1835–1910) was an American writer, humorist, and social critic.
                Known for classics like <em>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em> and <em>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</em>,
                Twain captured the complexities of American life during the 19th century. His later years were marked
                by outspoken opposition to imperialism, skepticism toward organized religion, and a relentless critique
                of hypocrisy in society.
